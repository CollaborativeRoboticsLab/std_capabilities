description: "This capability depends on the speaker capability of the audio stack and allow the robot to speak a given text. This  
              enables the decision making authority such as an LLM to communicate with voice. The capability can be triggered via 
              '<Event name=SpeakerRunner provider=SpeakerRunner text=$value/>' xml command. The '$value' represents what the robot 
              has to speak. As an example, if the robot recieves an command in the format of 
              '<Event name=SpeakerRunner provider=SpeakerRunner text='how are you'/>', the robot will speak 'how are you'. If an 
              response is expected for what the robot speaks, then it is required to have the listening capability triggered after 
              this capability is triggered successfully. This can be done via '<Event name=ListenerRunner provider=ListenerRunner/>' 
              xml command."
