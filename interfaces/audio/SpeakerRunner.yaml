description: "This capability allow the robot to speak a given text. This enables the decision making authority such as an LLM to 
              communicate with voice. The capability can be triggered via 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/SpeakerRunner provider=std_capabilities/SpeakerRunner text=$value/>' xml command. The 
              '$value' represents what the robot has to speak. As an example, if the robot recieves an command in the format of 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/SpeakerRunner provider=std_capabilities/SpeakerRunner text='how are you'/>', the robot 
              will speak 'how are you'. If an response is expected for what the robot speaks, then it is required to have the 
              listening capability triggered after this capability. This can be done via 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/ListenerRunner provider=std_capabilities/ListenerRunner/>' xml command."
