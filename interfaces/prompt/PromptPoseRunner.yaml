description: "This capability depends on the prompt tools stack functionalities and allows an decision making authority such as an
              LLM to recieve robot pose and orientation data from the robot. This capability can be trigged with the xml command
              '<Event name=PromptPoseRunner provider=PromptPoseRunner/>'. This will prompt the geometry_msgs/Pose msg in the xml 
              format and would allow the decision making authority to understand the position of the robot. Every execution plan 
              need to have this as one of the last compulsory capabilities to be executed, so that decision making authority is 
              updated about the latest position and orientation information of the robot which can then be used for future planning."
