description: "This capability allows an decision making authority such as an LLM to recieve robot pose and orientation data from the robot. This capability 
              can be trigged with the xml command '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner />'. This will 
              prompt the geometry_msgs/Pose msg in the xml format and would allow the decision making authority to understand the position of the robot. 
              Every execution plan need to have this as one of the last compulsory capabilities to be executed, so that decision making authority is updated 
              about the latest position and orientation information of the robot which can then be used for future planning. Data for this is generated by 
              a capability such as std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner which needs to be triggered before the std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner using an xml 
              command such as '<Event name=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner  map=map odom=odom robot=base_link/>'"
