description: "This capability depends on the prompt tools stack functionalities and allows an decision making authority such as an
              LLM to recieve robot capability information from the robot. This capability can be trigged with the xml command
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptCapabilityRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptCapabilityRunner model=llama3.1:8b stream=false/>'.
              This will prompt the capabilities in the xml format and would allow the decision making authority to understand the capabilities of 
              the robot. Default plan will contain this and execute at the beginning of each run and decision making authority does not
              need to execute this at the beginning."
