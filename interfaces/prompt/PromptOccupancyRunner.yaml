description: "This capability allows an decision making authority such as an LLM to recieve occupancy grid data from the robot. This capability can be 
              trigged with the xml command '<Runner interface=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner />'. 
              This will prompt the latest nav_msgs/occupancy_grid msg in xml format and would allow the decision making authority to understand the 
              position of the robot. Every execution plan need to have this as one of the last and compulsory capabilities to be executed this at the 
              end, so that decision making authority is updated about the latest environment information which can then be used for future planning. 
              Data for this is generated by a capability such as std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner which needs to be triggered before the 
              std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner using an xml command such as 
              '<Runner interface=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner provider=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner/>'"
