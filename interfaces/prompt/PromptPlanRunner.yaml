description: "This capability requests an decision making authority such as an LLM to create a new plan at the end of an execution plan. This capability 
              can be trigged with an xml command such as 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRunner replan=false task=$task/>'. This will prompt the 
              decision making authority to create a new execution plan either to continue the current task or to focus on a new task given by $task value 
              depending on the state of the robot. This capability needs to be in every execution plan created and needs be the capability before the last 
              in any  plan. All execution plans generated by a decision making authority need to be contained within <Plan> and </Plan> xml tags. Capabilities 
              within the execution plan can be organised using sqeuntial, parallel and recovery control flows. 
              
              Capabilities in the sequential control flow will be triggered one after the other depending on precceding capability's successful execution 
              and need to be contained within <Control name=sequential> </Control> xml tags. 
              
              Capabilities in the parallel control flow will be triggered one after another depending on precceding capability's successful start up and 
              will be executed parallely. Capabilities under parallel control flow needs to come within <Control name=parallel> </Control> xml tags. 
              
              Capabilities in the recovery control flow will be triggered one after other depending only on precceding capability's failed execution and 
              capabilities under recovery control flow need to come within <Control name=recovery> </Control> xml tags. 

              Upon the successful execution of this capability and creation of a plan, another capability need to be executed for verifying and starting the 
              execution of the new plan. It can be done via '<Event name=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner/>' 
              xml command.
              
              If the task has been completed according to the feedback information, do not include 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner/>' in the generated plan."
