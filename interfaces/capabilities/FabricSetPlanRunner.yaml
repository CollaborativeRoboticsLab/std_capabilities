description: "This capability transfers a newly created plan from the prompt tools to the fabric through the plan_server on the 
              capabilities2 fabric package. This needs to be included in every fabric where a new plan for execution is expected.
              The capability can be trigged with an command such as 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner/>'. This needs to be 
              triggered at the very end of each plan after 
              <Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRunner replan=false task=$task />
              so that the plan created by the decision making authority such as an LLM can
              be transferred to the capabilities2 executor for connection extraction and future triggering."
