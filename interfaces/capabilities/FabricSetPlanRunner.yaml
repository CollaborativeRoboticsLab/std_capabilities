description: "This capability transfers a newly created plan from the prompt tools to the fabric through the plan_server on the 
              capabilities2 fabric package. This needs to be included in every fabric where a new plan for execution is expected.
              The capability can be trigged with an command such as 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner provider=std_capabilities/FabricSetPlanRunner/>'. This needs to be 
              triggered at the very end of each plan so that the plan created by the decision making authority such as an LLM can
              be transferred to the capabilities2 executor for connection extraction and future triggering."
