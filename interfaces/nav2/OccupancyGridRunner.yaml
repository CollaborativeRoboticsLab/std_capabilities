description: "This capability depends on the navigation stack functionalities and allows the extraction of the occupancy grid map 
              produced by the robot's mapping or localization system. This extracted map can be used by the decision making authority 
              to understand the environment around the robot as well as possible navigation paths. This capability can be triggered 
              with '<Event name=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner provider=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner/>' xml command. 
              Upon the successful execution of this capability, another capability that allows occupancy grid data transfer to the 
              decision making authority needs to be triggered. Such a capability can be triggered via
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner  />' 
              xml command. The data structure used to transfer the data follows tha same structure as ros2 msg nav_msgs::msg::OccupancyGrid 
              and is allows follows,
                      ' <OccupancyGrid>
                            <header frame_id=map>

                            </header>
