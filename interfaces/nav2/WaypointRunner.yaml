description: "This capability depends on the navigation stack functionalities and allow the robot to navigate to a location given 
              by two dimensional coordinates. This capability can be used by the decision making authority such as an LLM to move 
              the robot to a required position and orientation. This capability can be triggered via the xml command
              '<Event name=WaypointRunner provider=WaypointRunner x='$value' y='$value' />'. '$value' represents a value in meters. 
              As an example '<Event name=WaypointRunner provider=WaypointRunner x='1.2' y='0.8' /> means the robot will move 1.2 
              meters forward and 0.8 meters to the right side."
