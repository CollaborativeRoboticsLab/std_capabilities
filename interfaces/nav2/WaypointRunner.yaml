description: "This capability depends on the navigation stack functionalities and allow the robot to navigate to a location given 
              by two dimensional coordinates. This capability can be used by the decision making authority such as an LLM to move 
              the robot to a required position and orientation. This capability can be triggered via the xml command
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/WaypointRunner provider=std_capabilities/WaypointRunner x='$value' y='$value' />'. 
              '$value' represents a value in meters. As an example 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/WaypointRunner provider=std_capabilities/WaypointRunner x='1.2' y='0.8' /> means the 
              robot will move 1.2 meters forward and 0.8 meters to the right side. capability std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner and
              std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner can be used to get the feedback on the position of the robot and by that, whether 
              the robot has reached the position or not."
