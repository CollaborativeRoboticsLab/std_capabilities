description: "This capability depends on the navigation stack functionalities and allows the extraction of the pose of the robot from 
              the odoemtry or localization system. This extracted robot pose can be used by the decision making authority to understand 
              the position and orientation of the robot. This capability can be triggered with an xml command as
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner  map=map odom=odom robot=base_link/>'.  
              Upon the successful execution of this capability, another capability that allows robot pose prompting needs to be triggered 
              for transfer of robot pose data to the decision making authority for future decision making. 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner  />' can be used 
              as an robot pose prompting capability for this. Data structure used follows the same structure as geometry_msgs::msg::Pose 
              and is as follows
                  ' <Pose>
                        <position x=1.23 y=4.56 z=7.89/>
                        <orientation x=0.12 y=0.34 z=0.56 w=0.78/>
                    </Pose>' "
